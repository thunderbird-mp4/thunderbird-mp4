# Hello, I am Thunderbird.
Here are some things about me:
- I am an intermediate programmer
- I mainly write my code in Python, but I sometimes dabble a bit with C++ for Arduinos and JavaScript for other things.
- I'm also sufficient in HTML and CSS, being able to create *decent* websites.

That's really all. Thanks for reading I guess.
